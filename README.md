classification_complete.py is the fle containing the trained model. The CSV folder contains the data to be trained on.


predictor_live.py is a python script to perform object detection in real time by drawing a digit on the screen and the prediction happens immediately after the digit has been drawn.

Instead of using a standard dataset such as MNIST, one can make his own dataset. screen_capture.py and gen_dataset.py facilitate this purpose.
